Hi this is Shivangi Shree. 
This is my first backend project. So this project will be memorable for me. I have used internet resources which helped me to easily create this website. I am thankful to internet resources and to my consistency that drived me to learn backend everyday, to push my code as much as possible and also thankful to my patience that stops me to pushing incomplete features stops me to push unnecessary things. My Git hub contribut of this year is low but I will make it high no matter what. Even Semester exams can't stop me. I will remain consistent and will remain devoted towards my goal of being full stack developer and a ML enthusiast.
